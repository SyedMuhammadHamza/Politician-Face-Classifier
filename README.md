# Politician-Face-Classifier
![Alt Text](https://github.com/SyedMuhammadHamza/Politician-Face-Classifier/blob/main/UI_Snapshot.gif)
* Collected images from google through web-scraping using Selenium with ChromeDriver 
*  Performed data cleaning through face detection using OpenCV pre-trained feature-based  Haar cascade classifiers to discard images from the dataset without face and two eyes visible  
* Performed feature engineering through extraction by wavelet transformation of images using PyWavelets and then vertically stacking raw and wavelet transformed images 
* trained machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM(Support vector machine), and Ensembling bagging Random Forest achieved 88% test accuracy after hyper tuning the model guided by learning curve analysis
*  Used HTML,CSS and JavaScript,
* Deployed model to production using Flask



# Technologies 
* Python
* Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
* Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
* Sklearn for model building
* Python flask for HTTP server
* HTML/CSS/Javascript for  UI

# Web Scraping
* Collected images from google through web-scraping using Selenium with ChromeDriver 

# Data Cleaning
*  Performed data cleaning through face detection using OpenCV pre-trained feature-based  Haar cascade classifiers to discard images from the dataset without face and two eyes visible  

# Feature engineering
* Performed feature engineering through extraction by wavelet transformation of images using PyWavelets and then vertically stacking raw and wavelet transformed images 

# Model Building
 trained models such as Inception-ResNet, Logistic Regression, SVM(Support vector machine), and Ensembling bagging Random Forest
 
# Inception-ResNet(Inception-v4)
* Implementation of Inception-Residual Network v1 [Inception Network v4 Paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07261v1.pdf) in Keras.
